# ayrTipCalculator
This is a calculator that keeps tracks of tips for full-time front of house employees. 

The calculator works as follows:

You type in the total amount of tips you earned for the day that you worked then answer the required questions. 

If a back of the house employee works that day, it will take 15% off of the total tips earned for the day.

Enter the total amount of full-time and part-time budtenders. 

Lastly, you enter the amount of hours you worked that day.


When you press 'collect tips' it will do the following calculation:

Take the total amount of tips you earned that day, if there is a back of house employee working that day, and will automatically deduct 15%. If no BoH works that day, there will be no deduction. 

After that it will take the new tip value and divide it by the total hours of all the employees worked that day.

Full-time: 8 hrs
Part-time: 5.5 hrs

Finally it will multiply that number by the total amount of hours you worked that day.

The calculated value will then appear as a list to the side and is saved under your local storage.
